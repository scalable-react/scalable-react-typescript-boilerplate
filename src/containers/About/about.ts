# Scalable React TypeScript Boilerplate

The boilerplate aims to follow best practices for building highly scalable and reusable apps and component libraries with React and cutting edge JavaScript.

We incorporate an ESLint configuration and follow strictly the [AirBnb JS & JSX style guides](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript).
